`My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all //
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all//
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall//
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad//
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin' //
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom//
I sent two letters back in Autumn, you must not have got them//
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'//
Sometimes I scribble addresses too slobby when I jot them//
But anyway, fuck it, what’s been up man? How's your daughter?//
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I’m 'bout to be a father!//
If I have a daughter, guess what I’m gonna call her?//
I'm gonna name her Bonnie//
I read about your uncle Ronnie too, I’m sorry//
I had a friend who killed himself over some bitch that didn't want him//
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I’m your biggest fan!//
I even got the underground shit that you did with scam//
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man//
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too, that shit was bad//
Anyway, I hope you get this man//
hit me back, just to chat, truly yours, this is your biggest fan...//
this is Stan//
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all//
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all//
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall//
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad//
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote,//
I hope you have a chance…//
I ain't mad, I just think it’s fucked up you don't answer fans.//
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside the concert, you didn't have to//
But you could have signed an autograph for Mathew,//
That’s my little brother man, he's only six years old//
We waited in the blistering cold for you for four hours and you just said no.//
That’s pretty shitty man, you’re like his fuckin' idle//
He wants to be just like you, man! He likes you more than I do!//
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like begin lied to//
Remember when we met in Denver?//
You said if I write you, you would write back!//
See I’m just like you in a way...//
I never knew my father neither,//
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her!//
I can relate to what you’re saying in your songs!//
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put them on cause//
I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I’m depressed//
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest!//
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds//
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me,//
See everything you say is real, and I respect you because you tell it//
My girlfriend's jealous because I talk about you 24/7//
But she don't know you like I know you Slim...no one does,//
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up//
You gotta call me man, I’ll be the biggest fan you ever lose!//
Sincerely yours, Stan//
P.S. We should be together too//
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all//
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all//
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall//
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad//
Dear Mr. I'm too good to Call or Write My Fans!//
This will be the last package I ever send your ass!//
It's been six months and still no word!//
I don’t deserve it?//
I know you got my last two letters,//
I wrote the addresses on them perfect!//
So this is my cassette I’m sendin' you, I hope you hear it!//
I'm in a car right now...I'm doin' 90 on a freeway!//
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?//
You know the song by Phil Collins, "Through the Air of the Night"?//
About that guy who could have saved that other guy from drownin' but didn't?//
And Phil saw it all and at a show he found him?//
That's kind a how this is, you could have rescued me from drownin'!//
But now it's too late, I’m on a 1000 downers now, I’m drowsy//
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or call//
I hope you know, I ripped all your pictures off the wall//
I love you Slim! We could have been together!//
Think about it, you ruined it now,//
I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it!//
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it!//
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me//
See Slim//
Shut up bitch I’m trying to talk!//
Hey slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk!//
But I didn't slit her throat! I just tied her up!//
See I ain't like you! 'Cause if she suffocates,//
she'll suffer more then she'll die too!//
Well, gotta go, I’m almost at the bridge now!//
Oh shit, I forgot! How am I supposed to send this shit out?!//
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all//
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all//
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall//
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad//
I meant to write you sooner, but I've just been busy!//
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now...how far along is she?//
Look, I’m really flattered that you would call your daughter that!//
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a starter cap.//
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must have missed you,//
Don't think I did that shit intentionally, just to diss you!//
What's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?//
I said that shit just clowning dog, come on, how fucked up is you?//
Your guys will miss you Stan,//
I think you need some counseling//
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some!//
And what’s this shit about us meant to be together?//
That's like the shit that will make me not wanna meet each other!//
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other,//
but maybe you just need to treat her better!//
I hope you get to read this letter,//
I just hope it reaches you in time...before you hurt yourself!//
I think you'll be doing just as fine if you just relax a little.//
I'm glad I inspire you but Stan, why are you so mad?//
Try to understand that I do want you as a fan!//
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit!//
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick!//
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge//
and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid//
and in the car they found a tape but it didn't say who it was to.//
Come to think about it, his name was...It was you! DAMN…//

Choyim sovib qoldi, hayronman, o’zi nimaga yotog’imdan turdim //
Ertalabki yomg’irli bulutlar ham derazam tepasida, hech narsani ko’rolmayapman //
Ko’rolsam ham, hammasi g’amgin tuyulardi, lekin devorimdagi sening rasming //
Menga hammasi hali unchalik yomonmasligini eslatadi, hammasi hali unchalik yomonmas//
Qadrli Slim, senga xat yozgandim, lekin haligacha yozmading,//
Telefon, peyjer, uy telefonim raqamlarini pastida yozib qoldirgandim//
Kuzda senga ikkita xat jo’natgandim, ularni olmagan bo’lsang kerak.//
Balki, pochtada qandaydir muammo bo’lgan bo’lsa kerak.//
Ba’zan tez yozganimda manzillarni judayam xunuk qilib yozib qo’yaman//
Baribir, ha mayli, ishlaring yaxshimi, oshna? Qizing qanday?//
Mening xotinim ham homilador, tez orada men ham ota bo’laman//
Agar qizli bo’lsam, top-chi, unga qanday ism qo’yaman.//
Men uni Bonnie deb atayman.//
Amaking Ronnie haqida ham o’qidim, juda afsusdaman//
Mening ham bir o’rtog’im bor edi, bir manjalaqi tashlab ketgani uchun o’zini o’ldirgandi//
Bilaman, bunaqa gaplarni sen har kuni eshitasan, lekin men sening eng katta muxlisingman!//
Xatto sen noqonuniy ravishda yerosti uyi qilganingni ham tushunaman.//
Menda sening plakatlaring va rasmlaring bilan to’la bitta xonam bor//
Menga Ruckus bilan aytgan ashulang ham yoqdi, rasvo chiqqan bo’lsayam.//
Har holda, bu xatimni olasan deb umid qilaman//
javob yoz, shunchaki gaplashishga, haqiqatda sening eng katta muxlising… //
Stan//
Choyim sovib qoldi, hayronman, o’zi nimaga yotog’imdan turdim//
Ertalabki yomg’irli bulutlar ham derazam tepasida, hech narsani ko’rolmayapman//
Ko’rolsam ham, hammasi g’amgin tuyulardi, lekin devorimdagi sening rasming//
Menga hammasi hali unchalik yomonmasligini eslatadi, hammasi hali unchalik yomonmas//
Qadrli Slim, haliyam qo’ng’iroq qilmading, yozmading//
Imkon toparsan deb umid qilaman…//
Ranjimayapman, shunchaki, muxlislarga javob yozmasliging jahlimni chiqaryapti//
O’shanda konsert tashqarisida men bilan gaplashishni istamagan bo’lsang, shart emasdi//
Lekin Mathew uchun imzoingni qo’yib bersang bo’lardi.//
U mening ukam bo’ladi, oshna, u endigina olti yoshda.//
Biz seni daxshatli sovuqda to’rt soat kutdik va sen shunchaki “Yo’q!” deding//
Judayam yoqimsiz bo’lgandi, oshna, u sening ashaddiy muxlising//
U faqat senga o’xshashni istaydi, oshna! U seni mendan ham ko’proq yaxshi ko’radi.//
Bundan ham jahlim chiqmaydi, lekin meni aldashlarini juda yomon ko’raman//
Eslaysanmi Denverda uchrashganimizda?//
Agar yozsam, javob yozishingni aytganding!//
Qara, ba’zi taraflarim senga o’xshaydi…//
Men ham otamni umuman bilmaganman//
u har doim onamga xiyonat qilardi va urardi!//
Qo’shiqlaringda aytganlaringga mening aloqam bor!//
Shuning uchun kunim yoqimsiz bo’lganida, qo’shiqlaringni eshitaman//
Menda haqiqatda boshqa narsayam yo’q, shuning uchun kayfiyatim yo’qligida bu menga yordam beradi//
Xatto ko’kragimda sening isming yozilgan tatiurovka ham bor!//
Ba’zan qanchalik qon oqishini ko’rish uchun qo’limni kesaman//
Bu xuddi adrenalinga o’xshaydi, og’riq men uchun shunday tezkor tuyg’uki//
Qara, sening hamma aytganlaring – haqiqat, va men seni hurmat qilaman chunki sen haqiqatni aytasan//
Xotinim ham rashk qiladi, chunki doimo faqat sen haqingda gapiraman!//
Lekin u seni menchalik bilmaydi, Slim… hech kim bilmaydi//
U bizga o’xshagan odamlarning ulg’ayishi qanday bo’lishini bilmaydi//
Menga qo’ng’iroq qil, oshna, sen yo’qotadigan eng katta muxlising bo’lishim mumkin!//
Birodaring, Stan!//
P.S. Biz birga bo’lishimiz kerak //
Choyim sovib qoldi, hayronman, o’zi nimaga yotog’imdan turdim//
Ertalabki yomg’irli bulutlar ham derazam tepasida, hech narsani ko’rolmayapman//
Ko’rolsam ham, hammasi g’amgin tuyulardi, lekin devorimdagi sening rasming//
Menga hammasi hali unchalik yomonmasligini eslatadi, hammasi hali unchalik yomonmas//
Qadrli Janob “Muxlislarimga Javob Yozish uchun Juda Zo’rlik qilaman”//
Bu sening orqangga jo’natayotgan oxirgi posilkam bo’ladi//
Olti oy bo’ldi, hali ham bitta so’z yo’q!//
Shunga arzimaymanmi?//
Bilaman, oxirgi ikki xatimni olgansan,//
Ularga manzillarini aniq yozganman!//
Shuning uchun bu jo’natayotganim – kasseta, eshitasan deb umid qilaman!//
Hozir mashinadaman… shosseda 150 da ketyapman!//
Hoy Slim, beshinchi aroqniyam ichdim, hayday olarmiding?//
Phil Collinsning “Through the Air of the Night”(Tun havosi bo’ylab) qo’shig’ini bilasanmi?//
Unda bir yigit cho’kayotgan yigitni qutqarishi mumkin edi, lekin qutqarmaydi!//
Va Phil uni o’zining konsertida uchratib qoladi//
Biz ham shunday vaziyatdamiz va sen meni cho’kishdan qutqarishing mumkin edi!//
Lekin endi juda kech, men minglab tinchlantiruvchi dori ichganman, boshim ham aylanyapti!//
Istagan narsam bittagina la’nati xat yoki qo’ng’iroq edi//
Bilsang, devordan hamma rasmlaringni yulib tashladim!//
Seni sevaman, Slim! Biz birga bo’la olardik!//
O’ylab ko’r, endi hammasini barbod qilding!//
Umid qilaman, kechalari uxlolmaysan, tush ko’rib chiqasan!//
Tush ko’rganingda ham, umid qilamanki, uyg’onib ketib, qichqirasan!//
Umid qilamanki, vijdoning seni yeb, mensiz nafas ololmay qolasan!//
Qara, Slim//
O’chir ovozingni, manjalaqi, men gaplashib olmoqchiman!//
Hoy Slim, bu mening xotinim, yukxonada qichqirayotgan//
Uni tomog’idan kesganim yo’q! Shunchaki uni bog’lab tashladim!//
Ko’rdingmi, men senga o’xshamayman! Chunki uning nafasi kelmasa,//
qizim ham ko’proq azob chekadi va keyin, o’ladi!//
Bo’pti, xayr, hozir deyarli ko’prikdaman//
Jin ursin, unutibman! Endi bu la’natini qanday jo’nataman?//
Choyim sovib qoldi, hayronman, o’zi nimaga yotog’imdan turdim//
Ertalabki yomg’irli bulutlar ham derazam tepasida, hech narsani ko’rolmayapman//
Ko’rolsam ham, hammasi g’amgin tuyulardi, lekin devorimdagi sening rasming//
Menga hammasi hali unchalik yomonmasligini eslatadi, hammasi hali unchalik yomonmas//
Qadrli Stan,//
Senga ertaroq yozmoqchi edim, lekin juda band edim!//
Xotinim homilador, dedingmi... Necha oylik bo’ldi?//
Qizingga bunday ism berishingdan boshim osmonga yetdi//
Va mana ukang uchun imzoim, kepkaga yozib qo’ydim//
Sizlarni konsertda ko’rmay qolganim uchun afsusdaman, o’tkazib yuborgan bo’lsam kerak!//
Faqat buni seni yerga urish uchun ataylab qildi deb o’ylama!//
Va yana, qo’lingni kesib, bu qanaqa ahmoqgarchilik?//
Men buni shunchaki zerikkanimdan qildim, deb aytdim-ku; sen shunga ishonib o’tiribsanmi?//
O’rtoqlaring seni sog’inib qoladi, Stan//
Menimcha, senga devordan sakrashing kerak bo’lib qolsa, orqangni ehtiyot qilishni o’rgatadigan bir maslahatchi kerak.//
Yana, biz birga bo’lishimiz kerak deganing nimasi?//
Bunaqa ahmoqgarchilikni yana aytsang, uchrashgim ham kelmay qoladi!//
Aminmanki, sen va xotining bir-biringizga keraksizlar,//
balki, shunchaki unga yaxshi munosabatda bo’lishing kerakdir!//
Umid qilamanki, bu xatni o’qiysan//
Umid qilaman, bu xat vaqtida yetib boradi… o’zingga bir narsa qilib qo’ymasang bo’ldi!//
Menimcha, biroz o’zingni bosib olsang, hammasi yaxshi bo’lib ketadi!//
Senga ilhom berishimdan xursandman, lekin Stan, nega buncha jahl qilasan?//
Tushunishga harakat qil, muxlis sifatida menga juda keraksan!//
Faqat o’zingga biror nima qilib qo’yishingni istamayman!//
Bir necha hafta oldin yangiliklarda ko’nglimni aynitgan bir ahmoqni ko’rsatishgandi//
Bir yigit ichib olib, mashinasini ko’prikdan haydabdi//
va yukxonaga xotinini ham solib olibdi – u homilador ekan//
va mashinadan bitta kasseta ham topib olishibdi, lekin kimgaligi ko’rsatilmagan ekan.//
Bir o’ylab ko’r, uning ismi… bu axir – sen! JIN URSIN…
